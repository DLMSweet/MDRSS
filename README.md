It's a terrible frontend for the Mangadex API!

You can search!

You can read!

You can even use it for RSS!

The use of WEBSCALE O(n^n^n) functions makes this able to support at least one concurrent user!

By utilizing ADVANCED, AI ALGORITHMS in the form of HYPERSCALE redis caching, we can even support a second user sometimes.

Truely, this is the best interface for Mangadex there is.
